# Ghost-bust
For our third project , my teammate Asmae Dalil and I  implemented/reproduced "Bust the Ghost" game. 

We explore the 8x 20 grid  according to prior distribution of Ghost over location P(Ghost)  While exploring the grid in order to find the ghost and to bust it , the Sensor readings tell how close a square is to the ghost

# •	On the ghost: red
# •	1 or 2 away: orange
# •	3 or 4 away: yellow
# •	 5+ away: green
